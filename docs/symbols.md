# Symbols / symbolism

What are symbols and what is symbolism? How do I spot what a symbol is and what it means?

## In a nutshell...

...a symbol is a mark or character that represents something. For example, we know that an arrow is a symbol that navigates us (to either go left, right, straight, etc). Symbols are like codes for representing something larger, like a sign or even a meme!
We talked about context in the previous section. Something like a meme makes us laugh because of its context, something that we understand or relate to. The meme acts as a symbol that points to the context, something that all symbols do.

Take the "It's Free Real Estate" meme. This clip is the context (taken from a larger video, the Tim and Eric Awesome Show). 
People have turned this clip into a meme / symbol by just using a image of the man's eyes:

![Meme](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LcmnRPAEAFXPBL6dJnr%2F-LdWxaDxEpoxmw29SLHy%2F-LdWzf-A2PulR1-ELFdm%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=46baa65c-eb15-4cf2-acf9-ad660f7409e4)

The image above is funny to those who know the **context**. If you don't know about the original video then the meme makes no sense at all and isn't as funny. Symbols and symbolism in art history is important because it often points to things that are outside of the work, and linked strongly to context like I have just described.
According to the Oxford Dictionary, symbol is defined as

> a mark or character used as a conventional representation of an object, function, or process, e.g. the letter or letters standing for a chemical element or a character in musical notation.
